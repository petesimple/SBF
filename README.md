# Snowboard Free

A tiny web game inspired by the classic “SkiFree” vibe, but on a snowboard.

Play it here  
https://petesimple.github.io/SBF/

## How to play

- Drag your finger (or mouse) to steer left and right
- You only move downhill when you are pointed downhill
- Hit moguls and halfpipes to get airtime
- While in the air:
  - Swipe up for a backflip
  - Swipe down for a frontflip
- Tricks are optional
- You only crash if you land while not pointing downhill

Keyboard (desktop)
- Left Arrow / Right Arrow to steer

## Features

- Endless mountain feel with a camera that follows your lateral movement
- Moguls and halfpipes launch you into the air
- Rails you can grind for extra points
- Combo system for chaining tricks
- Retro 8-bit style snowboarder sprite
- Share popup: tap the logo to show a QR code + quick share buttons

## Files

- `index.html` - the whole game (single-file HTML + JS)
- `logo.png` - game logo shown in the top right (tap to share)
- `SBF-QR.png` - QR code used in the share popup

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

This repo is meant for GitHub Pages.

1. Push to a repo named `SBF` (or any repo you want)
2. In GitHub:
   - Settings -> Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `main` (root)
3. Your game will be live at:
   - `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`

## Roadmap ideas

- Zones and “set pieces” like SkiFree (park area, tree runs, rail gardens)
- New obstacles and pickups (flags, speed boosts, score multipliers)
- Trick variety (spins, grabs) and trick chaining
- Better crash animation and replay moment
- Simple sound effects and a tiny music loop
